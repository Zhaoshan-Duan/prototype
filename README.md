# READ ME 

## Overview
> Propose and construct a project of your own design
- complete a provided project with specific guidelines. 

## Goal
> Feature-complete application ready to deploy to Google Play.

- Build a navigable interface consisting of multiple screens of functionality and data.
- Construct user interfaces that adhere to Android standards and display appropriately on screens of different size and resolution.
- Animate UI components to better utilize screen real estate and create engaging content.
- Connect to and consume data from a remote data source such as a RESTful API.
- Load network resources, such as Bitmap Images, dynamically and on demand.
- Store data locally on the device for use between application sessions and/or offline use.
- Architect application functionality using the MVVM design pattern.
- Implement logic to handle and respond to hardware and system events which impact the Android Lifecycle.
- Utilize system hardware to provide the user with advanced functionality and features.

## Questions to think about
- What buttons and text do I click normally in my favorite apps? What might their listeners do?
- What views might comprise my favorite app layouts?
- What Android versions do my favorite apps support? Why? 

Think about an idea for app you might like to build
- Have you ever wished there was an application that does something, but couldn’t find one? 
- Maybe there’s an application that you use but wish it had a better user experience or a different feature? 
- As you go through the lesson, think about how you might apply these concepts to develing that app. Consider sketching out possible designs with the components and properties that might be used.

- Where might I use these components in applications every day? How are they used?
- What data is needed to comprise the content of these applications?
- Which pieces of that data are static? Which pieces are dynamic?
- What is the relational layout of each of the components? How would you accomplish this? What constraints would be required?

- What is truly important to your user? How might those features look? What information will they need to display to the user?
- What information will the user provide? How do you plan on arranging that information?

## Features
> What feature do you consider core to your application ideas?

### Core Features

### Secondary Features
> secondary or nice to have features

- How many distinct features do the applications you use have?
- How are they arranged?
- What might the navigation graph look like for these applications?
- How do you, the user, navigate to and from each feature?
- What navigation methods are present?
- Do they work well with the hardware navigation?
- Have you ever felt abandoned or unable to get where you want to go?
- Are other applications a part of the experience? Browser, Camera, etc.
